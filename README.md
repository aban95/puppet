# Configuration as Code with Puppet

This repository contains Puppet manifests for automating the configuration of systems. The goal is to apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for consistent, repeatable, and scalable infrastructure management.

## Overview

This project uses the following tools:
- **Puppet**: A configuration management tool for automating server setups.
- **Vagrant**: Used for creating and managing virtual machine environments.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Puppet on your system or use a Puppet virtual environment.
3. Run the Puppet manifests to configure systems automatically.

## Example

The `site.pp` manifest is the main entry point, where all configurations are defined. It sets up basic server configurations, installs packages, and ensures services are running as required.

## Notes

- This project showcases Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Puppet, which is essential for managing large-scale server infrastructures.
